                        For over 17 years, I have been involved in software testing, primarily through functional tests
                        for user interfaces. However, I am also familiar with other types of tests, such as unit,
                        integration, performance, and stress tests. For all these tests, I use various free tools,
                        though recently I have been focusing mainly on Playwright using TypeScript.
